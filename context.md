# A Stable Climate and Thriving Human Civilization

1. We want a stable climate and thriving human civilization on Earth.

2. Climate scientists including from the IPCC have been studying the climate model. Their models say that to maintain a stable climate it is important to stay under 2˚C of warming over pre-industrial levels.

3. Climate scientists have also been studying what's needed to achieve that. The target: decarbonize to net zero plus remove 10 gigatons of carbon dioxide removal per year all by 2050. *(Technically the IPCC doesn't make targets though, so this isn't accurate.)*

4. *[Progress has been made, but how does it relate to the top goal?]*

## Are We on Track?

5. The question is: **is humanity on track for a stable climate by hitting these targets in 2050?**

6. **Regarding decarbonization:** *[Decarbonization progress].* *The idea is there would be a whole decarbonization plan that spins out of this.*

7. **Regarding carbon dioxide removal:** A recent report from RMI and the Bezos Earth Fund models that to be at 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide removal per year by 2050, then 285 million tons per year by 2030 is needed. *(Also: what's happening in 2050 decarbonization targets?)* Last year X was removed, so to be on track 300% year over year growth is needed through 2030. Last year carbon removal grew *[<300%]*. If nothing changes, 2050 will have carbon emissions of X tons per year and carbon dioxide removal of Y tons per year. *(Could do different framing, i.e. net zero by X, 10 GT/year by Z — but that seems less clear framing.)* This is **not on track**. And worse, as the Earth loses albedo and darkens, feedback loops and climate tipping points are coming up sooner than predicted *(sources)*. *The idea is there would be a whole removal plan that spins out of this.*

## What Happens If We Miss?

8. *[Miss targets in 2050, tipping points, everything flips — also pull from sources here.]* *The idea is there would be a whole backup plan that spins out of this.*

## What Can Be Done to Close the Gap?

9 .Long term there's not an alternative to decarbonizing and removing carbon dioxide at gigaton scale. So decarbonization and carbon removal ultimately need to get there *(tighten this up)*. But, what if there was a way to buy some time to make up the gap? *(This may be a weak spot in the argument — perhaps it's better to push harder on removal and decarbonization, find leverage, etc.)*

### Push Removal and Decarbonization Faster

10. One thing we can do is push removal and decarbonization faster to make up the gap. For example, if carbon removal this year grows X%, then we make up the gap in just one year. More capital, more investment, more experimentation to get things on track for net zero by 2050 and 10 gigatons of carbon dioxide removal annually. We need breakthroughs in removal and decarbonization broadly. There is some flexibility — if decarbonization goes better, then there may be less carbon removal needed and vice versa, but not entirely. i.e. if net zero happened today we would still need some carbon removal. *(How accurate is that for the above 2050 frame, and how much?)*

### How Much Time Do We Need to Buy?

11. The goal has been to get decarbonization to net zero and carbon removal to 10 gigaton per year scale by 2050. Let's say because of the delays we're at 2075 instead of 2050. So for the sake of this argument there's a **25 year gap** to make up. *(This is a good point to check whether you agree/disagree, have other thoughts here.)*

## Climate Interventions

12. Now that we have identified the gap, is there anything that actually fits? It would have to be very cheap, because it would have to beat "just spend the money and time on decarbonization and removal."

13. There are several concepts that might fit. I say "might fit" because we don't know if they will work. Let's call these **"Climate Interventions"** — things like slowing the melting of glaciers, averting heat waves, saving coral reefs, and cooling the planet.

### Sunlight Reflection

14. One concept that's got a lot of attention is cooling the planet by reflecting sunlight away from the planet. The rest of this document unpacks that, but there are other categories of interventions you could look at.

15. As a pathway, sunlight reflection doesn't need all that much innovation. A few things to try: stratospheric aerosol injection, cloud brightening, giant sunshade, cloud thinning. But it likely doesn't benefit from 1,000 different approaches in the same way as carbon removal. The biggest challenge is around governance. It's possible there are more approaches needed, but given governance and policy challenges there will be big benefit from concentration/centralization.

### Aerosol Injection

16. One promising pathway for large scale sunlight reflection is aerosol injection.
